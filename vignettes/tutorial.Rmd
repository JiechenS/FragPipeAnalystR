# Introduction

FragPipeAnalystR is a R package intended for FragPipe downstream analysis. We also make it compatible with the result obtained from FragPipe-Analyst. Users are able to reproduce and customize the plots generated in FragPipe-Analyst.

## Quick Start Example
``` {r include=T, warning=F}
library(FragPipeAnalystR)
data("ccrcc", package = "FragPipeAnalystR")
```

``` {r include=T, warning=F}
plot_pca(ccrcc)
```

``` {r include=T, warning=F}
plot_correlation_heatmap(ccrcc)
```

``` {r include=T, warning=F}
plot_missval_heatmap(ccrcc)
```

``` {r include=T, warning=F}
plot_feature_numbers(ccrcc)
```

``` {r include=T, warning=F}
sessionInfo()
```
