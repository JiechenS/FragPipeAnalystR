# Introduction

FragPipeR is a R package intended for FragPipe downstream analysis. We also make it compatible with the result obtained from FragPipe-Analyst. Users are able to reproduce and customize the plots generated in FragPipe-Analyst.

## Quick Start Example
``` {r include=T, warning=F}
library(FragPipeR)
data("ccrcc", package = "FragPipeR")
```

``` {r include=T, warning=F}
plot_pca(ccrcc, n=500, ID_col="label", exp="TMT")
```

``` {r include=T, warning=F}
plot_correlation_heatmap(ccrcc, indicate="condition", exp="TMT")
```

``` {r include=T, warning=F}
plot_missval_heatmap(ccrcc)
```
